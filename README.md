# GoBarber2020
Project developed with typescript using nodejs, reactjs and react-native. 
In this application the user can provide a barber ou hairdresser service while other users can make appointments with those service providers. 

## Requirements
To open and run this project you will need:
* [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) *this link is for windows*
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)
* [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/)
* [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [mongodb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwMwO8pXfq0)
* redis

In order to run and open react-native projects you will need to setup the enviroment and install some dependencies. You might follow their very well explained getting started tutorial in the following link: 
* [getting started with react-native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.61/getting-started)

## Getting Started

* Create or choose a folder where you gonna clone the project.
* Clone the repository with the command `git clone https://github.com/djanlm/GoBarber2020.git`.
* Run `yarn` to install all dependencies in each folder.

#### Backend

You will need all your databases running to be able to store and fetch data from them. Postgres was used to store Appointments and users information. Redis was used to cache data so that we have faster responses.
Instead of installing all those database management system in your machine you can use docker and install them there. 

Run the migrations.

Configure your own .env file. In the repository there's an .env.example that can be used as a model. You might need to switch localhost for your ip address in the following line:
`APP_API_URL = http://localhost:3333`

To run the backend server, go to the backend folder and run the command `yarn dev:server`. It will run on port 3333.

#### Web
To run the frontend part developed for web using reactJS, go to the *gobarber_web* folder and run `yarn start`

#### App 
To be able to run the app for cellphone, you'll need an emulator. I'd recommend android studio emulator. As mentioned before you might follow the react-native [getting started tutorial](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.61/getting-started).

Once you have your emulator running, go to *gobarbermobile* folder and run the command `npx react-native run-android`

You might need to switch the code on the api.js file depending on which emulator you're using to run your mobile app:

```
  baseURL: "http://10.0.2.2:3333", // android studio
  baseURL: 'http://10.0.3.2:3333', // genymotion
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3333', // ios
  baseURL: 'http://network_ip_address:3333', // via usb
```
